The Flexbox layout model provides a set of properties that control the alignment, spacing, and flow of items within a flex container. Here's an explanation of the roles of key properties in the Flexbox layout model:

1. justify-content
Role:

The justify-content property aligns flex items along the main axis (horizontally by default).
It determines how the remaining space in the flex container is distributed among flex items when they do not take up all the available space.
Possible Values:

flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the main axis.
flex-end: Items are packed toward the end of the main axis.
center: Items are centered along the main axis.
space-between: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
space-around: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed with equal space between them.

2. align-items
Role:

The align-items property aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertically by default).
It determines how flex items are placed within the flex container when they do not take up all the available space on the cross axis.
Possible Values:

stretch (default): Items stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width).
flex-start: Items are aligned toward the start of the cross axis.
flex-end: Items are aligned toward the end of the cross axis.
center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
baseline: Items are aligned such that their baselines align.

3. gap
Role:

The gap property defines the space between flex items.
It replaces the need for using margin properties on individual items to create spacing.
Possible Values:

A length value (e.g., 10px, 1rem, etc.) specifying the gap size.

4. flex-direction
Role:

The flex-direction property defines the direction in which flex items are placed in the flex container.
It sets the main axis along which the flex items are laid out.

Possible Values:

row (default): Items are laid out in a row (left to right in a left-to-right context).
row-reverse: Items are laid out in a row but in reverse order (right to left in a left-to-right context).
column: Items are laid out in a column (top to bottom).
column-reverse: Items are laid out in a column but in reverse order (bottom to top).

5. flex-wrap
Role:

The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
Possible Values:

nowrap (default): All flex items are placed in a single line.
wrap: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
wrap-reverse: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, but from bottom to top.
